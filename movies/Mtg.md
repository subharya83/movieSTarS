# Movie Trailer Generation from Script

This project aims to generate a movie trailer automatically from a given movie script. The system leverages a dataset of 9000+ movie scripts and 2000+ trailer pairs to train a generative model. The goal is to create a trailer that includes key dialogues, background music, voice narration, and visual elements (e.g., AI-generated avatars of actors) based on the input script.

## Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Movie scripts and corresponding trailers are collected automatically using web scraping tools.
   - Trailers are sourced from platforms like YouTube, while scripts are obtained from publicly available sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the collected data (e.g., extract audio, transcribe speech, perform speaker diarization, and analyze facial expressions from trailers).
   - Align script data with trailer content to identify key dialogues, scenes, and actors.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Fine-tune an open-source generative model using the script-trailer pairs.
   - The model will learn to identify critical parts of the script (e.g., key dialogues, scenes, and characters) to include in the trailer.

4. **Trailer Generation**:
   - Given a new script, the model will generate a trailer by:
     - Selecting key dialogues and scenes.
     - Generating AI-based avatars for actors (if real actors are not available).
     - Adding background music and voice narration.
     - Creating a cohesive 2.5-minute trailer.

## Key Features

- **Script Analysis**: Analyze movie scripts to identify key dialogues, scenes, and main characters.
- **Trailer Synthesis**: Generate trailers by combining visual, audio, and textual elements.
- **AI-Generated Avatars**: Create virtual actors based on character descriptions in the script.
- **Background Music and Narration**: Add music and voiceovers to enhance the trailer's impact.

## How to Achieve the Task

### Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
1. **Collect Movie Scripts and Trailers**:
   - Use web scraping tools to gather movie scripts and corresponding trailers.
   - Store the data in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV).

2. **Preprocess Data**:
   - Extract audio from trailers and transcribe speech using tools like `whisper` or `Google Speech-to-Text`.
   - Perform speaker diarization to identify different speakers in the trailer.
   - Analyze facial expressions and scenes using computer vision libraries like OpenCV or `face-api.js`.

3. **Align Scripts and Trailers**:
   - Match transcribed dialogues from trailers with corresponding parts of the movie script.
   - Identify key scenes and dialogues that are frequently used in trailers.

### Step 2: Model Training
1. **Choose a Generative Model**:
   - Use an open-source model like GPT-3, T5, or BART for text generation.
   - Fine-tune the model on the script-trailer pairs to learn the relationship between scripts and trailer content.

2. **Train the Model**:
   - Input: Movie scripts with annotated key scenes and dialogues.
   - Output: Trailer scripts (including dialogues, narration, and scene descriptions).

### Step 3: Trailer Generation
1. **Input a New Script**:
   - Provide a new movie script as input to the trained model.

2. **Generate Trailer Content**:
   - The model will identify key dialogues, scenes, and characters.
   - Generate AI-based avatars for characters using tools like `DALL-E` or `Stable Diffusion`.
   - Add background music and voice narration using audio generation tools like `Jukebox` or `WaveNet`.

3. **Compile the Trailer**:
   - Use video editing tools (e.g., FFmpeg or Adobe Premiere Pro) to compile the generated content into a 2.5-minute trailer.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - `whisper` (for speech transcription)
  - `OpenCV` (for facial expression analysis)
  - `transformers` (for fine-tuning generative models)
  - `FFmpeg` (for video editing)
- GPU for training and inference (recommended).

## Example Workflow

1. **Input**: A movie script (text file).
2. **Process**:
   - Analyze the script to identify key dialogues and scenes.
   - Generate AI-based avatars for characters.
   - Add background music and voice narration.
3. **Output**: A 2.5-minute trailer video.

## Future Enhancements

- **Realistic AI Avatars**: Improve the quality of AI-generated avatars using advanced GAN models.
- **Dynamic Music Generation**: Use AI to generate custom background music based on the script's mood.
- **Multilingual Support**: Extend the system to support scripts and trailers in multiple languages.
